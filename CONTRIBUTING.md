## Rules of Contributing

1) Always make a `Branch` based on what `Issue` is left.
2) Assign Yourself before starting any `Issue`.
3) After pushing your code to the `Branch`, name the `PR` according to the `Issue` Name.
4) Assign somebody to review it.

For eg.,
If the `Issue` name is `StyleGAN`, you should name the branch as `StyleGAN` and after pushing the code make a PR to `master` branch and let the reviewer review it.

## Note: Never Merge you own branch. Let the reviewer do his/her job.
